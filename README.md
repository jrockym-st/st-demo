# Welcome to my project page

Hello Sporttrade team. The purpose of this git is to demonstrate utilizing Ansible and AWS in creating a K8 cluster. It's a very simple implementation, but it creates the skeleton systems with a hands off approach. I'd be more than happy to delve a little deeper into the specifics of how each piece works. I used off-the-shelf roles to implement the Kubernetes master and worker nodes, however ran into a number of issues when implementing the roles.

This was my first time using the ec2 plugin for dynamic inventory, along with setting up boto for AWS integration. Overall, it was a good introduction to the cloud pieces of AWS.
